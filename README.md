In this assighnment we are implementing the following :
* Hill Cipher encryption and decryption.
* Cryptanalysis of Hill Cipher.

## Hill cipher Encryption and Decryption
* For encryption use the following command 
```
python3 encrypt.py <key file> <plain-text file> 
```
* For decryption use the following command
```
python3 decrypt.py <key file> <cipher-text file>
```
